Task 1: Extend Employee Data
Add More Fields to Employee Data:
Extend the employee data to include fields like joiningDate, performanceRating.
Update the existing CRUD operations to handle the new fields.

Task 2: Aggregate Data
Get Employees by Department:
Create an endpoint to fetch all employees belonging to a specific department.
Implement filtering based on the department field.
Get Average Salary by Department:
Create an endpoint that calculates the average salary for each department.
Return a list of departments with their average salary.
Get Employees by Performance Rating:
Create an endpoint to fetch employees based on their performance rating.
Implement filtering to fetch employees with a performance rating above a certain threshold.

Task 3: Advanced File Handling
Paginated Results:
Implement pagination for the list of employees.
Create endpoints that return a specific number of employees per page and allow navigation between pages.
Sort Employees:
Create an endpoint to fetch employees sorted by a specific field (e.g., name, salary, joining date).
Allow sorting in both ascending and descending order.

Task 4: Data Aggregation and Reporting
Employee Count by Department:
Create an endpoint to return the number of employees in each department.
Total and Average Salary:
Create an endpoint to return the total and average salary of all employees.
Annual Salary Report:
Generate a report (e.g., JSON or CSV file) that provides details like total salary expenditure, average salary, and salary distribution across different departments.

Task 5: Additional Functionalities
Update Employee Records in Bulk:
Create an endpoint to update multiple employee records in one request.
This can be used to apply a common change to a group of employees (e.g., annual salary increment).
Employee History:
Implement a feature to track changes to employee records.
Store previous versions of employee data and create an endpoint to fetch the change history for a specific employee.

Task 6: Optimizations and Best Practice
Optimize File I/O Operations:
Review the file I/O operations and optimize for better performance (e.g., reading and writing data in chunks).
Code Refactoring:
Encourage them to refactor their code to improve readability and maintainability.
Use middleware for common tasks like logging, error handling, and validation.
